This server code sets up a basic API to login to our website. It uses a mongodb database, mongoose, express, and Node to set up
the website's backend. Right now, we have a simple Schema set up for a User with a username, password, email, first name, last name,
and "about" section. We also have defined endpoints to read a given user, read all users, create a new user, update a given user,
and delete a given user. We have also begun (incomplete) implementation of JSON Web Tokens for authentication and registering of 
users.
